# Photon counter
This is a photon counting Monte Carlo simulation package for exoplanet photometry.

The original version of this package was developed by Deepak Rohilla (2023) under the supervision of Oisin Creaner. [The original Python notebook is linked here](/archive/deepak_project.ipynb).  Future versions will diverge from this.
